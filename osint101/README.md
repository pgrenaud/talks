# I will look for you and I will find you: OSINT on publicly shared pictures

![I will look for you and I will find you: OSINT on publicly shared pictures](social-card.png)

> Liam Neeson is coming for you. But how will he find you? Come to this talk to learn how the picture of a firetruck you took in front of your house and shared on Instagram two years ago will be the source of your demise.
>
> In this talk, I will share how I developed this compulsive habit, in which I need to find where a picture was taken. We will cover how to perform open-source intelligence (OSINT) on publicly shared pictures and videos, which tools and techniques to use, accompanied with real step-by-step examples.
>
> I believe that understanding how OSINT works is key to better protect ourselves online. I'm aiming to give you the tools and knowledge to be better cybersecurity professionals, and learn to be more careful and diligent online, all in a (hopefully) fun and engaging way.
>
> Not convinced yet? This talk will also cover the following topics: metadata (d'oh!), physical keys (who doesn't like keys?), data in public registries, and conclude with Do's and Don'ts for everyone.
